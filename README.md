# JTAG Master VIP (Verification IP)
A comprehensive JTAG (IEEE 1149.1) Master Verification IP for SystemVerilog/UVM testbenches, providing complete JTAG TAP controller functionality and boundary scan operations.

## Overview

The JTAG Master VIP implements a complete JTAG master controller that can drive JTAG operations on Device Under Test (DUT). It supports all standard JTAG instructions and provides a high-level API for verification engineers to easily create JTAG test sequences.

### Key Benefits
